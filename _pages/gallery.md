I attended the ESWEEK'23 as a speaker and part-time co-host of Workshop on Agile Design and Optimization Tools for Processing-In-Memory (DOT-PIM).

## MacLehose Trail, Hong Kong, China, Dec. 2022

<img src="/images/2022_一生所爱[1].jpg" />

This photo was taken when I was hiking along the MacLehose Trail Section Two with my friends. I was standing at a special point in my life, almost the end of my 30th year. I may become a teacher, a father, and a more mature man in the coming new year. The lonely but beautiful scene recalled me to the song 一生所爱 and the question often asked in my mind recently: How many roads must a man walk down, before they call him a man?
